Explore how to create a table grid that contains nested arrays as rows within a table. 
The rows will each contain the number of cells needed for the number of columns set 
in the variables. This grid table will dynamically adjust depending on the values for 
the variables.

const grid = [];
const cells = 64;
let counters = 0;
let row;
for (let x = 0; x < cells + 1; x++) {
    if (counters % 8 == 0) {
        if (row != undefined) {        
            grid.push(row);
        }
        row = [];
    }
    counters++;
    let temp = counters;
    row.push(temp);
 
}
console.table(grid);
