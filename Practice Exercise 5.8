This exercise will demonstrate how to create a string with all the digits as it loops through them. We can also set a value to skip by adding a condition that will use continue, skipping the matching condition. A second option is to do the same  exercise and use the break keyword.

let outputs = ""; 
let skipThiss = 7; 
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) { 
  if (i === skipThiss) { 
    continue; 
  } 
  outputs += i; 
} 
console.log(outputs);

//  Alternatively, the following code could be used, replacing continue with break:  //

let output = "";
let skipThis = 7;
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i === skipThis) {
    break;
  }
  output += i;
}
 
console.log(output);
