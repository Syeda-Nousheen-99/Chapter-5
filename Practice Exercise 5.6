This exercise will construct an array as it loops through the incrementing values of 
x. Once the array is done, this exercise also will demonstrate several ways to output 
array contents. 

const myArray = [];
for (let x = 0; x < 10; x++) {
    myArray.push(x + 1);
}
console.log(myArray);
for (let i = 0; i < myArray.length; i++) {
    console.log(myArray[i]);
}
for (let val of myArray) {
    console.log(val);
}
