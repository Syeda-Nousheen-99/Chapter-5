In this exercise we will use a for loop to create an array that holds objects. Starting 
with creating a blank array, the block of code within the loop will create an object 
that gets inserted into the array.

let simpleCounter = 0;
let step = 2;
do {
    console.log(simpleCounter);
    simpleCounter += step;
}
while (simpleCounter <= 100);
