In this exercise we will be generating a table of values. We will be using loops to 
generate rows and also columns, which will be nested within the rows. Nested arrays 
can be used to represent rows in a table. This is a common structure in spreadsheets, 
where each row is a nested array within a table and the contents of these rows are 
the cells in the table. The columns will align as we are creating an equal number of 
cells in each row.

const myTable = [];
const rows = 4;
const cols = 7;
let counter = 0;
for (let y = 0; y < rows; y++) {
    let tempTable = [];
    for (let x = 0; x < cols; x++) {
        counter++;
        tempTable.push(counter);
    }
    myTable.push(tempTable);
}
console.table(myTable);
