In this exercise we will use a for loop to create an array that holds objects. Starting 
with creating a blank array, the block of code within the loop will create an object 
that gets inserted into the array.

const myWork = [];
for (let x = 1; x < 10; x++) {
    let stat = x % 2 ? true : false;
    let temp = {
        name: `Lesson ${x}`, status: stat
    };
    myWork.push(temp);
}
console.log(myWork);
